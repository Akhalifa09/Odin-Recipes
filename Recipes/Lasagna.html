        <H2>Description</H2>
            <p>
            <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling.<br> 
                A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan.<br> 
                I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.<br></p>
