        <H2>Description</H2>
            <p>
                This cherry pie recipe includes a buttery homemade crust and easy cherry filling.<br>
                I was so pleased when this recipe got first place in the 1999 American Pie Council's National Pie Championship!<br>
                This old-fashioned cherry pie recipe features a classic fruity filling in a buttery homemade pastry crust.<br>
                It’ll be a welcome dessert on any table!<br>

                    <li>
                        2 cups pitted sour cherries
                    </li>
                    <li>

        <H2>Steps</H2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Gather the ingredients.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Whisk flour and salt together in a bowl. Cut in shortening with 2 knives or a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.<br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mix in cold water by hand just until dough holds together. Divide dough in half and form into disks.<br>
                         Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, 30 minutes to 1 hour.<br>
                    <li>
                        Roll out 1 dough disk into an 11-inch circle and press it into a 9-inch pie dish.<br>
                        Place in the refrigerator until needed.<br>
                   
                    <li>
                        Roll out remaining dough disk into an 11-inch circle for the top crust, transfer it to a plate or baking sheet, and refrigerate until needed.<br>
                         Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place a baking tray in the oven to preheat.<br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Place cherries, sugar, and cornstarch in a medium, non-aluminum saucepan.<br>
                        Allow mixture to stand until juices begin to release, about 10 minutes.<br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly.<br>
                        Lower the heat and simmer until juices thicken and become translucent, about 1 minute.<br>
                        Remove from heat and stir in butter and almond extract. Allow filling to cool to lukewarm.<br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pour cooled filling into prepared pie crust.<br>
                        Cover with top crust, trim and crimp the edges to seal, and cut vents for steam.<br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bake in the preheated oven on the preheated baking tray until crust is golden brown, 45 to 55 minutes.
                         Allow to cool for several hours before slicing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Serve with a scoop of ice cream and enjoy!
